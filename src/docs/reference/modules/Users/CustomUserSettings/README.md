# Custom Users Settings (`OrchardCore.User.CustomUserSettings`)

Custom Users Settings allow a site administrator to create a customized set of properties for a given user.  

## Creating Custom User Settings

Custom User Settings are organized in sections. Each section is represented by a Content Type with the `CustomUserSettings` stereotype.  
When creating such a section, remember to disable `Creatable`, `Listable`, `Draftable` and `Securable` metadata as they don't apply.

!!! warning
    Don't mark any existing Content Type with this `CustomUserSettings` stereotype, as this will break existing content items of this type.

Custom User Settings are then comprised of parts and fields like any other content type.  
Once created, open the Setting menu item and each of these sections should appear alongside the module-provided ones.

## Usage

### Liquid

The Custom User Settings are available when loading the user from the database. 
```liquid 
{% assign user = User | user_id | users_by_id %}
{{user.Properties}}
```
Each section is made available using its name.

For instance for a custom settings section named `UserProfile`, with a `TextField` named `FirstName` would be accessible using `{{ user.Properties.UserProfile.UserProfile.FirstName.Text }}`.

### Placement

By default each Custom User Settings Content Type is placed in a tab.

To adjust the placement, for example, to move the setting out of the tab, use the `Differentiator` of `CustomUserSettings-PartDefinitionName`.

``` json
{
  "CustomUserSettings": [
    {
      "place": "Content:10#Content",
      "differentiator": "CustomUserSettings-UserProfile" 
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Section Display Driver

You may also extend the `User` properties by implementing a `SectionDisplayDriver<User, UserProfile>` where `User` is the type of entity to be edited,
and `UserProfile` is the property to extend the `User` entity with.
